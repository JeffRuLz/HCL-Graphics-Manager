Hydra Castle Labyrinth Graphics Manager is a java program designed to help modify Hydra Castle Labyrinth's graphics data.
This program can also be used for Buster's other games. However, my only concern is that it works with Hydra Castle Labyrinth.

==About .QDA Files==

Hydra Castle Labyrinth stores all of its graphics files in a .qda (Quadruple D Archive) file. Essentially, it's a bunch of unencrypted 8-bit BMP files stacked on top of each other in one file.
HCL Graphics Manager can pluck out a BMP file and import an edited version back in.

==Using HCLGM (for total dummies)==

(Now in video form: https://youtu.be/TsoYnMzWMB0)

(Exporting)

1. Run the .jar file and select File > Open Bmp.qda...

2. Select your Bmp.qda file (Hydra Castle Labyrinth's file is stored by its .exe file) and click open.

3. Wait a few seconds and a preview should appear.

4. Use the drop down list to select a graphics file.

5. Click the "Export..." button to save the currently selected file to a location of your choice.

(Editing)

6. Open the newly created .bmp file in an image editing program of your choice.

7. Make your desired edits.

8. This is important: save your file as an 8-bit bmp file. It should be the same size as before you changed it.

(Importing)

9. Go back to HCL Graphics Manager. If you cannot see a preview, open your bmp.qda file again.

10. Select your file in the drop down list

11. Click the "Import..." button, and choose the file that you've just finished editing.

12. Wait for a success message and click okay. That's it! Start Hydra Castle Labyrinth and your changes should appear in the game.
